My first game development project was to recreate the first area of Metroid for the NES using the Unity game engine. With a partner, we also incorporated a bonus mechanic. We were both big fans of the on/off switch from the Mario universe. Therefore, we created a custom level enhancing Metroid's gameplay by using an on/off switch. It can be accessed by pressing the "4" key.
