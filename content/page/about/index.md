## About Me
My name is Gustavo D'Mello and I'm interested in procedural generation, computational geometry, and game development. In December of 2021, I graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Currently, I am an Adobe Certified Expert working remotely as an AEM Developer for a consulting firm. In my current role, I have been able to wear many hats as I assist in developing our clients’ full stack. This has included working as a front-end React developer, as well as a back-end developer using the Sling and JCR API’s. My goal is to work as a software engineer for a large tech company that has a significant presence in the gaming industry.  

## Inspiration
There are several reasons why I created this website. Firstly, I wanted to showcase my passions and problem-solving skills and how I apply them to my interests during my free time. Secondly, I wanted to keep myself accountable with how I spend my time and not succumb to ‘tutorial hell’. Lastly, I wanted to hopefully help others out there, as other blogs have helped me with my pursuits.

## Activities
When the weather permits, I love to go fishing with friends and family. When the weather doesn't permit, I like to play Smash Bros. Ultimate and read manga.
