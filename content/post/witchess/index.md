For my final project of EECS 494, I co-created a third-person, puzzle-strategy game where a young witch embarks on a journey to rescue her cat. You must use her four elemental spells to navigate through chess-board-like levels littered with enemies and obstacles. My role in the group was Lead Game Designer. I led development of the core game design, grid-based movement systems, and spell-interaction systems. My favorite part of this project was implementing the A* (pronounced "A-star") path search algorithm for player and enemy movement.
